# Unsupservised-Sentence-Summarization-Based-on-HC-summarization

This repo gives an implementation to fine tune pretrained Transformers on summarization task. To simply the implementation, our development is based on HuggingFace.  

Our supported pretrained Transformers include:
gpt2, xlnet-base-cased, xlm-mlm-en-2048, T5.

We have finished the implementations with GPT2, will finish the implementations with other Transformers soon.
